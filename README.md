                      HERE are some basic nodes from the library.


## Steps for using the Library

To use the custom nodes in this library all you have to do is copy the `addons` folder from this repo to your project and `paste it there`.

Then just goto the `Project Setting` and then in `Plugins tab` and set the `Plugin("VisualScript Library") to Active`.

## What can you do to help

I would have loved to ask for donation or something, but for now lets keep it at why not create some more nodes just for practice learn from my GetInput Node it's got good amount of comments you should be able to figure things out on your own for help PM me on @steincodes on Twitter and follow me there for more updates on the project.

Just before starting on creating any-thing check out my [Trello Visual Script Nodes Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/cie89S57/c342cf76c3743f56ede99b0d0f27dd87/visual-scripting-nodes) for updates and add your own projects so that I am in the loop, and don't waste my energy.
