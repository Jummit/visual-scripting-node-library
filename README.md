## Steps for using the Library

To use the custom nodes in this library you have to copy the `addons` folder from this repo into your project.

Then go to  `Project Setting>Plugins` and set the status of the `VisualScript Library` plugin to activate.

## Explanation of the nodes

### The `Load Directory` node

This node is useful for loading all the files in a directory into a [dictionary](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_dictionary.html). These files can be any files that can be loaded with the [ResourceLoader](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_resourceloader.html). This is useful for loading random scenes or textures for example.

## What you can do to help

I would have loved to ask for donation or something, but for now lets keep it at why not create some more nodes just for practice, learn from my `GetInput` node, it has got a good amount of comments, you should be able to figure things out on your own. For help PM me on @steincodes on Twitter and follow me there for more updates on the project.

Keep track in the project board of any updates and plans before starting something.
